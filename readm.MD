# My basecamp of Javascript
   ## First Project - CalculatorJS
   
   ###  This project consists of improving my javascript base, as well as others that I will do successively to this one.
              
         -> Here I applied basic concepts of functions, conditional, including in this case, using 'switch' and not 'if' or 'else', 
            at I could get better acquainted with the tool.

         -> In this exercise was used:
               - Number() - to convert values to numbers
               - prompt() - to log user inputs
               - Alert() - to show message to user
               - template Strings - to use Spring together with expressions
